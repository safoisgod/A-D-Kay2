                        We are thrilled to announce the upcoming release of <strong>"Killed by Illiteracy"</strong>, a powerful and thought-provoking book by Ampem-Daako Kay.

                        The story follows a group of individuals living in a small rural town where access to education is scarce, and illiteracy runs rampant. Through compelling storytelling, Ampem-Daako Kay weaves a narrative that highlights the struggles of people who are unable to read or write, their fight for survival, and the societal pressures that keep them from rising above their circumstances.
                    </p>

                        The characters in the book are vividly portrayed, and readers will find themselves deeply invested in their journeys. Each chapter dives into the psyche of individuals who face the everyday challenges of living in a world where illiteracy is a barrier to success, relationships, and even basic survival.
